What seems to be the moral of the story here? If you want to be good at this type of work, you need put the time in.

Philosophy of this class:
* This course combines creative research, experimentation and technique. We'll be focusing on the p5js programming environment to make make stirring, experimental and provocative new forms of culture.
* Our medium is software and electronics, it is the means of production but it is not the end goal.
* If you want to use different tools and environments, or try things that are not outlined in class you are welcome to do so and you will be supported to do this.

##Working with technology (particularly new environments like p5) has it's challenges:

* Here's Zach Lieberman on working with technology and failure:
